## Authors: Amy McGovern, Kiri L. Wagstaff

**Abstract** <br>
*The challenge of using Machine Learning effectively in space applicationcs can help the domain for future research endeavours ML can help build an autonomy to improve the duration, reliability, cost effectiveness and in general the overall field, for the machine learning researchers the key task is to identify new methods and scientific techniques of applying machine learning solutions and approaches to help the field advance.*

1. **Space Operations: A challenge for Machine Learning** <br>
A great number of discovery and assistance tools required in this field are autonomous robotic system developed to assist Astronauts and the Analysis teams that are behind the mission. Autonomy is critical in these mission to our limited capacity.
