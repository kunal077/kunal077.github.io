## Authors: Amy McGovern, Kiri L. Wagstaff

**Abstract** <br>
*The challenge of using Machine Learning effectively in space applicationcs can help the domain for future research endeavours ML can help build an autonomy to improve the duration, reliability, cost effectiveness and in general the overall field, for the machine learning researchers the key task is to identify new methods and scientific techniques of applying machine learning solutions and approaches to help the field advance.*

-> **Space Operations: A challenge for Machine Learning** <br>
A great number of discovery and assistance tools required in this field are autonomous robotic system developed to assist Astronauts and the Analysis teams that are behind the mission. Autonomy is critical in these mission to our limited capacity. The teleoperation is cost sensitive and also there is a large communication delay between the environment and the operator. The external aid and repairing capacity are limited in near future. Some of the open ended questions are - 
<ul>
<li>What approaches are currently available that are appropriate for this setting? What constraints do they have?
</li>
<li>How can the demand for safety be incorporated?<</li>
<li>How can we strike a balance between possible risks and benefits?</li>
</ul>
The space applications area is expected to necessitate novel approaches to machine learning challenges and solutions.

-> **Existing ML and AI Techniques in Space Research**
Autonomous operation helps a remote spacecraft to observe its environment and make independent decisions about which actions to take and what data is important enough to be collected. one of the most interesting example could be intelligent rovers which can identify patterns, send over data to spacecraft etc. Support Vector Machines (SVM) regression model was one of the first algorithm to be used on rover to neatly identify ice, land, water and other terrains. Due to high radiaion, memory might get corrupted and cause algorithms learn and perform significantly sub par. The most important step right now is to create a conjugation of Space Research Experts and Machine Learning or Artificial Intelligence experts to come togethter and collaborate.

-> **Opportunities for Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in Space**
The majorly identified area of conjugated research can be Image Analysis, Time Series Analysis, Classification, Clustering, Reinforcement Learning, Ranking, Active Learning, Interospective Learning, Multi-Instument ensemble learning. Along with these capacitites the challenges of limited Processing power, limited memory capacity, high-radiation environment, long round trup communication delays and high cost of failure and fault tolerance and embedded operation needs to be addressed. 

-> **An Example : Onboard Object Recognition for Planetary Exploration**
The above mentioned research paper provides an example of machine learning research inspired by the needs of actual space missions. This paper procides an SVm-based technique for identifying craters that directly addressess the limited computation and memory of radiation-hardened processors. The authors of the paper proposed a novel Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) technique that enables the SVM to run much more efficiently and within the limits of onboard processing capabilitites. As compared to Neural Networks and vanilla SVMs, the FFT SVM provided a much improved computational capactities. 

-> **Call to Action**
Advanced machine learning approaches for space applications are needed, according to this editorial. Machine learning has the potential to substantially enhance the capabilities of these missions, as well as to enable bold new exploration that is now impossible. The authors urge the machine learning community to work together to solve problems.
